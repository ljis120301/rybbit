If you've installed the Rybbit tracking script but aren't seeing any traffic in your dashboard, this guide will help you diagnose and fix common issues.

## Check if the Script is Loaded

The first step is to verify that the Rybbit script is properly loaded on your page.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open Your Browser's Developer Console

Right-click anywhere on your webpage and select **Inspect** (or **Inspect Element**). Then click on the **Console** tab at the top of the panel that opens.

Alternatively, you can use keyboard shortcuts:
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + J` or `F12`
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Option + J`
</Step>

<Step>
### Type "rybbit" and Press Enter

In the console, type `rybbit` and press Enter.

**If the script is loaded correctly**, you'll see an object with functions like this:
```javascript
{event: ƒ, pageview: ƒ, identify: ƒ, setTraits: ƒ, clearUserId: ƒ, …}
```

**If the script is NOT loaded**, you'll see an error like:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: rybbit is not defined
```

If you see the error, the script is not loading properly. Continue reading for common causes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Issues

### Data Attributes Being Stripped

Some platforms, content management systems, and tag managers automatically remove or sanitize `data-*` attributes (or all non-standard attributes) from script tags. This means the `data-site-id` attribute required by Rybbit gets removed, causing the script to fail silently.

**Platforms known to strip attributes:**
- Google Tag Manager
- Some WordPress page builders
- Certain website builders (Webflow, Wix, Squarespace in some configurations)
- Some CDN or caching plugins

**Solution:** Instead of using the standard script tag, inject the script dynamically using JavaScript:

```javascript
<script>
  (function() {
    var el = document.createElement("script");
    el.src = "https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js";
    el.defer = true;
    el.setAttribute("data-site-id", "YOUR_SITE_ID");
    document.head.appendChild(el);
  })();
</script>
```

This approach creates the script element programmatically and sets the `data-site-id` attribute via JavaScript, which bypasses any HTML sanitization.

### Ad Blockers

In rare cases, ad blockers may block the Rybbit tracking script. While Rybbit is privacy-focused and doesn't use cookies for tracking, some aggressive ad blockers may still flag analytics scripts.

**How to check if an ad blocker is the issue:**
1. Temporarily disable your ad blocker
2. Refresh the page
3. Check the console again for the `rybbit` object

**Solutions:**
- **For your own testing**: Disable your ad blocker or add your site to the allowlist
- **For your visitors**: Consider setting up a [proxy](/docs/proxy-guide) to serve the script from your own domain, which significantly reduces the chance of being blocked

### Script Not in the Right Location

The Rybbit script should be placed in the `<head>` section of your HTML. If it's placed in the wrong location or loaded after the page has already finished loading, it may not work correctly.

**Verify the script placement:**
1. View your page source (right-click → **View Page Source**)
2. Search for `rybbit` or `script.js`
3. Confirm it appears within the `<head>...</head>` tags

### Incorrect Site ID

Double-check that your `data-site-id` matches the site ID shown in your Rybbit dashboard.

1. Go to your Rybbit dashboard
2. Navigate to your site's settings
3. Copy the site ID and compare it with what's in your script tag

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Blocking

If your site has a strict Content Security Policy, it may block the Rybbit script from loading or executing.

**Check for CSP errors:**
1. Open the browser console
2. Look for errors mentioning "Content Security Policy" or "CSP"

**Solution:** Add the Rybbit script domain to your CSP headers:

```
script-src 'self' https://app.rybbit.io;
connect-src 'self' https://app.rybbit.io;
```

If you're self-hosting Rybbit, replace `app.rybbit.io` with your Rybbit instance domain.

### Script Loading Too Late in SPAs

In single-page applications (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.), if the script loads after the initial page render, the automatic pageview might not fire.

**Solution:** Ensure the script is in your root HTML template (like `index.html` or `_document.js` in Next.js), not dynamically imported in a component.

For Next.js specifically, see our [Next.js Guide](/docs/guides/nextjs).

## Testing Your Installation

Once you've made changes, verify that tracking is working:

1. **Check the console**: Type `rybbit` to confirm the object exists
2. **Trigger a test event**: In the console, run:
   ```javascript
   rybbit.event("test_event")
   ```
3. **Check your dashboard**: Navigate to the Events tab in your Rybbit dashboard and look for "test_event" (it may take a few seconds to appear)
4. **Check the Network tab**: In browser dev tools, go to the Network tab, filter by "track" or "rybbit", and verify requests are being sent with 200 status codes

## Still Having Issues?

If you've tried all the above and are still not seeing traffic:

1. **Check the browser Network tab** for any failed requests to your Rybbit instance
2. **Verify your site ID** is correct in the dashboard
3. **Check if traffic is being filtered** - review your [IP exclusions](/docs/hiding-own-traffic) and [country exclusions](/docs/filter-traffic) to ensure your traffic isn't being blocked
4. **For self-hosted instances** - ensure your Rybbit server is running and accessible

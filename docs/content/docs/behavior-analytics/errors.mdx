The Errors tab shows JavaScript errors occurring on your website, helping you identify and fix bugs that affect user experience.

## Enabling Error Tracking

Enable error tracking in your [site settings](/docs/site-settings).

## Error Information

For each error, you'll see:

- **Error Type** - ReferenceError, TypeError, SyntaxError, NetworkError, etc.
- **Error Message** - The specific error message
- **Stack Trace** - The chain of function calls that led to the error
- **Affected Users** - Number of unique users who encountered this error
- **Occurrence Count** - How many times the error was triggered
- **First/Last Seen** - When the error first appeared and most recently occurred
- **Affected Pages** - Which pages generated this error
- **Browser & Device** - Which environments experience this error

## Using Error Data

- **Prioritize by impact** - Fix errors affecting the most users first
- **Monitor after deployments** - Watch for new errors after releasing code
- **Debug user reports** - Find the exact technical issue when users report problems
- **Track third-party issues** - Identify when external integrations are malfunctioning

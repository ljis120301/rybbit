## User Metrics

For each user, you'll see:

- **User ID** - Anonymized identifier
- **First/Last Visit** - When they first and most recently visited
- **Total Sessions** - Number of separate visits
- **Pages Viewed** - Total pages across all sessions
- **Events Triggered** - Total custom events
- **Device Type** - Desktop, mobile, or tablet
- **Location** - Geographic location

## Filtering Users

Filter by:

- Number of sessions or page views
- Specific events triggered
- Device type or location
- First visit or last activity date

## Identified Users

If you use the [identify API](/docs/identify-users), you can see your own user IDs alongside the anonymous identifiers.

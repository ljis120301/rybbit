The Events tab shows custom events tracked on your website.

## Setting Up Events

See the [Track Events guide](/docs/track-events) for implementation details.

## Events Page

The events page includes:
- **Events Chart** - Visualize event trends over time
- **Custom Events List** - All tracked events with counts
- **Event Log** - Recent individual event occurrences

## Event Metrics

For each event:
- **Event Name** - The name you assigned to the event
- **Count** - Total times triggered in the selected period
- **Percentage** - Share of total events

## Event Properties

Click the expand arrow on any event to view its properties. Properties show the key-value pairs attached to events, helping you understand event context (e.g., which product was purchased, what button was clicked).

## Filtering

- Click any event name to filter the dashboard to sessions containing that event
- Use the filter panel to combine event filters with other dimensions
- Filter by time range to analyze event trends

- **Events Triggered** - Custom events fired during the session
- **Device & Browser** - Technical environment
- **Location** - Geographic location based on IP
- **Entry/Exit Page** - Where the session started and ended
- **Bounce Status** - Whether the user left after one page

## Filtering Sessions

Filter by:

- Device type, browser, or location
- Referrer or traffic source
- Date range

## Session Replay

If [session replay](/docs/product-analytics/replay-session) is enabled, you can watch a recording of any session to see exactly what the user did.

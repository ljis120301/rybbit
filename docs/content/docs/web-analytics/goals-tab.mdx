![Goals Dashboard](/blog/rybbit_goals_dashboard.png)

Goals let you track specific outcomes like signups, purchases, or key page views.

## Creating a Goal

Click "Create Goal" and provide:
- **Goal Name** (optional) - Descriptive name like "Newsletter Signup"
- **Goal Type** - Page Goal or Event Goal

### Page Goals

Trigger when users visit specific URLs.

- **Path Pattern** - The URL to match (e.g., `/checkout/complete`)
- **URL Parameters** (optional) - Match specific query parameters

Use wildcards in path patterns:
- `*` matches a single path segment
- `**` matches multiple segments

### Event Goals

Trigger when custom events fire. Requires [event tracking](/docs/track-events) to be implemented.

- **Event Name** - The event to track (e.g., `sign_up_completed`)
- **Event Properties** (optional) - Match specific property key-value pairs

## Goal Metrics

For each goal:
- **Conversions** - Total number of times this goal was triggered
- **Conversion Rate** - Percentage of sessions that converted

A progress bar shows the conversion rate visually.

## Viewing Conversions

Click any goal to expand it and view the sessions that converted. This helps you understand who is converting and what they did.

## Managing Goals

- **Edit** - Modify goal configuration (type cannot be changed)
- **Clone** - Create a copy of an existing goal
- **Delete** - Remove a goal permanently

description: Visualize geographic traffic distribution
---

The Globe tab shows where your visitors connect from on an interactive map.

## View Modes

### 2D Map
- **Timeline** - View sessions by timeframe, click individual sessions for details
- **Coordinates** - Sessions as dots with color intensity showing traffic volume
- **Countries** - Countries highlighted by traffic volume
- **Subdivisions** - Granular view by national subdivisions

### 3D Globe
Same four views as 2D, plus:
- Rotate by dragging
- Zoom in and out
- Traffic hotspots glow

The 3D view requires a Mapbox API token. Self-hosted installations need `MAPBOX_TOKEN` in environment variables. Cloud includes this automatically.

## Time Controls

Pick date ranges to see how geographic distribution changes over time.

## Filtering

Apply the same filters as the main dashboard to see geographic distribution for specific segments.

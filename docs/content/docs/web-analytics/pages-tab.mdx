![Pages Dashboard](/blog/rybbit_pages_dashboard.png)

The Pages tab shows detailed analytics for every URL on your site.

## Page Metrics

Each page displays:
- **Page URL** - The full path
- **Sessions** - Number of sessions that viewed this page
- **Average Time on Page** - How long visitors spend there

## Filtering

Use the same filters as the main dashboard to analyze specific segments:
- Mobile users from social media
- Desktop users who converted
- Users who triggered specific events

## Identifying Issues

- Sort by lowest time on page to find content that isn't engaging
- Sort by fewest sessions to find underperforming pages
- Compare entry pages to see which content attracts traffic

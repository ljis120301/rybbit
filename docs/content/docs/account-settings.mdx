</Callout>

## API Keys

Generate API keys to access Rybbit's analytics endpoints from your applications.

### Creating an API Key

1. Enter a name for your API key (e.g., "Production App", "Development")
2. Click "Create"
3. Copy and save the generated key immediately

<Callout type="warn">
  API keys are only shown once when created. Store your key securely as you won't be able to view it again.
</Callout>

### Managing API Keys

Your existing API keys are displayed in a table showing:
- **Name** - The name you assigned to the key
- **Key** - A preview of the key (first few characters)
- **Created** - When the key was created

You can delete API keys that are no longer needed. Deleting a key immediately revokes access for any applications using it.

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in requests to Rybbit's API endpoints. See the [API documentation](/docs/api) for available endpoints and usage examples.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

<Callout type="info">
  On self-hosted instances, this workflow is slightly different. Instead of inviting users, you can create a new user and set their password directly since self-hosted instances don't send emails. 
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the user to your organization

Go to https://app.rybbit.io/organization "Add Member" button in the top right. Enter the user's email address and select the user's role.
</Step>

<Step>
### Select the user's role

You can either make the user an admin or a member.

**Admins** can invite other users, add websites, edit websites, delete websites, and see all website data.

**Members** can see website data, but they cannot edit anything. By default, members can see all websites in your organization.

#### Restricting site access for members

When inviting a member, you can optionally restrict their access to specific sites. Check the "Restrict access to specific sites" option and select which sites the member should be able to view.

If you don't enable this option, the member will have access to all sites in your organization.

<Callout type="info">
  Site access restrictions only apply to members. Admins and owners always have full access to all sites.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Send the invite

Click the "Invite" button. The user will receive an email with a link to sign up for Rybbit. You can manage all invites in the organizations tab.

</Steps>

## Managing site access for existing members

You can change a member's site access at any time after they've joined your organization.

1. Go to the Members page in your organization settings
2. Find the member in the list and click on their "Site Access" badge
3. Toggle "Restrict access to specific sites" and select the sites they should have access to
4. Click "Save changes"

The member will immediately only see the sites you've selected. If you disable the restriction, they'll regain access to all sites.

<Callout type="info">
  Currently, each user can only be in one organization.

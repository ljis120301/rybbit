## Privacy & Security

### Public Analytics

Make your analytics publicly accessible by enabling the "Public Analytics" toggle.

- External viewers have read-only access to your analytics data
- Viewers cannot edit settings, reports, funnels, or goals
- Your other websites are not affected

### User ID Salting

Rybbit stores user IDs as a hashed combination of IP + user agent. This allows identifying users across sessions, but may be considered storing personally identifiable data under GDPR.

Enable "User ID Salting" to have Rybbit forget about unique users every day. If a user visits 10 times in one day, they count as one user with 10 sessions. But if they visit once a day for 10 days, they appear as a new user each day.

**Downsides of enabling user ID salting:**
- User session history beyond 24 hours is not available
- Unique user counts over periods longer than 24 hours will be inflated
- The user retention page becomes effectively useless

### Block Bot Traffic

Enable "Block Bot Traffic" to prevent traffic from known bots and crawlers from being tracked in your analytics.

### Track IP Address

Enable "Track IP Address" to store the IP address of visitors.

<Callout type="warn">
  This is not GDPR compliant. Only enable if you have a legitimate need and proper consent mechanisms in place.

## Analytics Features

### Session Replay <span className="text-green-500 text-sm">(Pro)</span>

Record and replay user sessions to understand user behavior. This feature allows you to see exactly how users interact with your site.

### Web Vitals <span className="text-green-500 text-sm">(Standard)</span>

Track Core Web Vitals metrics including:
- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint)
- **FCP** (First Contentful Paint)
- **TTFB** (Time to First Byte)

### Error Tracking <span className="text-green-500 text-sm">(Standard)</span>

Capture JavaScript errors and exceptions from your site to identify and fix issues affecting your users.

### Track Outbound Links

Track when users click on external links leaving your site. Enabled by default.

### Track URL Parameters

Include query string parameters in page tracking. Enabled by default. Disable if you want cleaner URLs in your analytics or need to exclude sensitive parameters.

### Track Initial Page View

Automatically track the first page view when the tracking script loads. Enabled by default.

### Track SPA Navigation

Automatically track navigation in single-page applications (SPAs). Enabled by default. This detects URL changes via the History API and tracks them as page views.

## Traffic Filtering

### IP Exclusions

Block specific IP addresses or ranges from being tracked. Supports:
- Individual IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`)
- CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)
- IPv4 ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.1-192.168.1.255`)

### Country Exclusions

Block all traffic from specific countries using ISO country codes (e.g., `US`, `DE`, `FR`).

Both filtering methods work at the server level, ensuring blocked traffic never reaches your analytics database.

## Google Search Console <span className="text-green-500 text-sm">(Cloud)</span>

Connect your Google Search Console account to see search performance data alongside your analytics.

## Change Domain

Update the domain for your site. Changing domains does not affect existing data - all historical analytics are preserved.

## Delete Site

Permanently delete a site and all associated data.

<Callout type="warn">
  This action cannot be undone. All analytics data, reports, funnels, and goals will be permanently deleted.
</Callout>

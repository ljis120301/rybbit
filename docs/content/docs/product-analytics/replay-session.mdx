Session replay lets you watch anonymized recordings of real user sessions, showing mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and page navigation.

## Enabling Session Replay

Enable session replay in your [site settings](/docs/site-settings), or add the attribute to your tracking script:

```html
<script
  src="https://your-rybbit-instance.com/api/script.js"
  data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
  data-session-replay="true"
  defer
></script>
```

## What You'll See

- Mouse movements and clicks
- Scrolling behavior
- Page navigation
- Form interactions (with PII masked)
- User details: country, device, browser

## Using Session Replay

- **UX optimization** - Identify where users get stuck or confused
- **Debug issues** - See exactly what happened when users report problems
- **Understand behavior** - Go beyond metrics to see the full user story
- **Share with your team** - Collaborate on findings

## Privacy

Session replay automatically masks sensitive information. Enable PII protection in your settings for additional masking of form inputs and text content.

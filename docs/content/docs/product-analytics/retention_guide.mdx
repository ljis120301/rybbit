![Retention Dashboard](/blog/rybbit_retention_dashboard.png)

Retention analysis shows how many users come back to your site over time, revealing whether users find lasting value.

## Understanding Cohorts

A cohort is a group of users who share a common start date. For example, all users who first visited on January 15th form one cohort.

## Reading the Retention Table

### Rows
Each row is a different cohort, grouped by first visit date.

### Columns
- **Day/Week 0** - Starting point (always 100%)
- **Day/Week 1, 2, 3...** - Users who returned after that period

### Numbers
Percentages show what portion of the original cohort returned. 40% in the "Day 7" column means 40% of users came back after a week.

### Color Coding
- Lighter colors = higher retention
- Darker colors = more drop-off

## Key Insights

- **Day 1 retention** - Did users find enough value to return the next day?
- **Day 7 retention** - Did users integrate your product into their routine?
- **Day 30 retention** - Have users formed a habit?

## Common Patterns

- **Cliff drop** - Sharp decline in first few days indicates onboarding issues
- **Steady decline** - Gradual drop suggests novelty wearing off
- **Plateau** - When retention levels off, you've found your core users

## Note on User ID Salting

If [User ID Salting](/docs/site-settings) is enabled, retention beyond 24 hours becomes less accurate since user identifiers reset daily.

User journeys show the actual paths people take as they move through your website, revealing how they flow from page to page.

## Reading the Visualization

### Nodes
Each circle represents a page or event. The size indicates how many users reached that point.

### Connections
Lines between nodes show user flow. Thicker connections mean more users took that path.

### Flow Direction
The visualization flows left to right, showing progression through time.

## Key Patterns to Look For

- **Happy Path** - The most common route to conversion
- **Drop-off Points** - Where many users enter but few continue
- **Backtracking** - Users moving backward, often indicating confusion
- **Alternative Routes** - Unexpected paths to important pages

## Using Journey Insights

- **Simplify complex paths** - Create shortcuts to important pages
- **Fix drop-off points** - Investigate why users leave at certain pages
- **Amplify successful paths** - Make high-converting routes easier to follow
- **Reduce backtracking** - Improve navigation where users get lost

## Analysis Types

- **Entry point analysis** - Where do users go from a specific page?
- **Goal-based analysis** - How did converting users get there?
- **Full journey mapping** - Overall flow from entry to exit

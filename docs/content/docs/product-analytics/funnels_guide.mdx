Funnels track users as they move through a series of steps toward a goal, showing where users convert and where they drop off.

## Creating a Funnel

Click "Create Funnel" and define your steps. Each step can be:
- **Path** - A URL path (e.g., `/pricing`, `/checkout`)
- **Event** - A custom event name (e.g., `signup_clicked`, `purchase_completed`)

### Step Configuration

For each step, you can configure:
- **Type** - Path or Event
- **Value** - The path pattern or event name
- **Label** (optional) - A friendly name for the step
- **Hostname** (optional) - Filter to a specific domain
- **Property Filters** (optional) - Match specific URL parameters or event properties

### Wildcards

Use wildcards in path patterns:
- `*` matches a single path segment (e.g., `/blog/*` matches `/blog/post-1`)
- `**` matches multiple segments (e.g., `/docs/**/intro` matches `/docs/api/v2/intro`)

## Funnel Metrics

For each step:
- **Sessions** - How many sessions reached this point
- **Conversion Rate** - Percentage of the first step that reached this step
- **Dropped** - How many sessions dropped off before this step

The visualization shows two bars:
- **Solid bar** - Overall conversion from the first step
- **Striped bar** - Conversion from the previous step

## Viewing Sessions

Click any step to expand it and view:
- **Reached** - Sessions that completed this step
- **Dropped Off** - Sessions that completed the previous step but not this one

This helps you investigate why users drop off at specific points.
